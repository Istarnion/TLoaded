# TLoaded
A simple data representation for Tiled map files.

Currently only supports JSON file format. Might extend to support the proper TMX files as well.

Note that this library only does data representation. It does not load images, it does not draw anything.
It aims to be a simple way to get data from map files, in an environment-agnostic manner.
